      <p>OMORI is a video game desined by indie game designer OMOCAT. OMORI was released in 2020, and was in development for 6 years. It was originally intended to be a graphic novel, but the game desiners decided to make it a game so players could mae their own choices.</p>
      <p>A Kickstarter campaign was launched in 2014, and was successfully funded within one day. OMOCAT initially planned for OMORI to be released in May of 2015, however, due to unforseen problems, the game took an additional 5 years to develop. </p>
      <p>In 2020, OMORI received its final release date of December 25, when it was released on Microsoft Windows and macOS via Steam. Initially available only in English, the Japanese version was released on December 16, 2021. Following this, the support for Simplified Chinese and Korean languages was added on March 18, 2022.</p>
      <p>The Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One versions of OMORI were first announced during Playism's Tokyo Game Show 2019 presentation on September 11. Playism also announced it would be working on a Japanese release of the game, which was initially planned for 2020, but later delayed. During an Indie World presentation in December 2021, it was announced that a Nintendo Switch version would release in Q2 2022. After a slight delay, the PlayStation 4 port followed on June 24, 2022. These versions were developed by MP2 Games, and feature additional content not found in the original Steam release. The physical edition by Fangamer for Nintendo Switch and PlayStation 4 was initially planned to launch alongside the digital release, but did not launch until early July of 2022.</p>
      <p>Multiple publications positively reviewed the game's depiction of anxiety and depression, with Rock Paper Shotgun reviewer Kat Bailey comparing it to her real-life experiences. According to her, the game managed to take overused themes regarding the subject and create a "memorable darkness". Watts stated that the game "captures this sentiment [of overcoming anxiety] masterfully", but criticized some parts of the game for being too dark.</p>

      <p>OMORI's gameplay is inspired by traditional Japanese role-playing games. The gameplay is split between two places, HEADSPACE and FARAWAY TOWN. In HEADSPACE, the player controls a party of four characters: OMORI, AUBREY, KEL, and HERO. In FARAWAY TOWN, the player begins with only SUNNY, and slowly gains party members as he reconnects with his friends. Each party member possesses their own unique skills for use both in battle and in overworld traversal.</p>
      <p>The overworld portion is played from a top-down perspective. The game features side quests and puzzles for the player to solve, bestowing them with various rewards and skills upon completion. In HEADSPACE, many beneficial weapons and items can be obtained, with some being purchasable using HEADSPACE's currency, CLAMS. In FARAWAY TOWN, the currency is dollars, and most found or purchasable items have little practical use outside of progressing the story.</p>
      <p>Battles are played out in a turn-based format in which each party member performs a move. After attacking, party members can work together to perform "follow up" attacks. Follow ups use "Energy," a collective resource which starts at 3 at the start of each battle, and is gained when a party member takes damage, up to a maximum of 10. Characters and enemies have HEART, which functions as health points; if damage is taken, it decreases, and if it reaches zero, the character is defeated and turns into TOAST. The Juice meter is used to perform skills, special abilities which aid in battle. Outside of battle, the party can heal and save by encountering a picnic blanket, associated with OMORI's older sister MARI.</p>
      <p>Unlike most role-playing games, status effects are based on a three-pointed emotion system. A party member or opponent's emotion can change throughout the course of a battle, usually due to moves by another party member or enemy. NEUTRAL is the baseline and has no effects; ANGRY increases attack but lowers defense; SAD increases defense but lowers speed, as well as converting a portion of damage to HEART into damage to JUICE; and HAPPY increases luck and speed but lowers accuracy. Emotions are either strong or weak against each other â€“ HAPPY beats ANGRY, ANGRY beats SAD, and SAD beats HAPPY. Additionally, higher-intensity variants of each emotion also exist.</p>
